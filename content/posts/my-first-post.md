## What is Markdown
Before talking about what Markdown is, we should first introduce Markup.

The most popular Markup language is HyperText Markup Language or HTML. Markup allows us to use tags to structure a web document. Despite Markup being widely used, tags that are used to annotate text can be long and take time to write.

So Markdown was developed by  [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) and [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) to be easy to read and convertible to valid HTML.

## Basic Syntax

### Headings
Headings are created by adding number signs (#) in front of text.

    # Heading
The more number signs (#) you add the smaller the heading becomes.

### Italicized
To italicize text, add an asterisk (*) before and after the word or a phrase.

    *The phrase to italicize*

### Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks (**) before and after the word or a phase.

    **The phrase to bold**

>To italicize and bold text use three asterisks

### Blockquote
To blockquote text, add a (>) in front of a paragraph

### Code Blocks
To add code blocks, use a tab or four spaces.

### Links
To make a link add hard brackets [] around the text and the url afterwards with soft brackets () around it.

### Images
Images are similar to links but should have an exclamation mark (!) before the text.
